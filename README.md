## Cracking the Coding Interview

### Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

- [x] 1.1 - Is Unique
- [x] 1.2 - Check Permutation
- [x] 1.3 - URLify
- [x] 1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
- [x] 1.5 - One Away -> See generatePermutations and printNumbersWithBase under Helpful_Problems for examples of the naive case.
- [x] 1.6 - String Compression
- [x] 1.7\* - Rotate Matrix
- [x] 1.8\* - Zero Matrix
- [x] 1.9 - String Rotation -> Had difficulty visualizing what a rotation was, becomes easier once able to visualize. Also see isSubstring under Helpful_Problems.

### Chapter 2 - Linked Lists

- [x] 2.1 - Remove Dups
- [x] 2.2 - Return Kth to Last
- [x] 2.3 - Delete Middle Node -> I overcomplicated this one on my first attempt. This is as simple as finding the node before the one to remove, and changing its pointer to the one after it.
- [x] 2.4 - Partition
- [x] 2.5 - Sum Lists
- [x] 2.6 - Palindrome
- [x] 2.7 - Intersection
- [x] 2.8\* - Loop Detection -> This one requires you to know the "Tortoise and the Hare" algorithm for its best solution. I would recommend reviewing this algorithm in detail, especially how to return the index of the start of the cycle.
