## Cracking the Coding Interview

### Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

- [x] 1.1 - Is Unique
- [x] 1.2 - Check Permutation
- [x] 1.3 - URLify
- [x] 1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
- [x] 1.5 - One Away -> See generatePermutations and printNumbersWithBase under Helpful_Problems for examples of the naive case.
- [x] 1.6 - String Compression
- [x] 1.7\* - Rotate Matrix
- [x] 1.8\* - Zero Matrix
- [x] 1.9 - String Rotation -> Had difficulty visualizing what a rotation was, becomes easier once able to visualize. Also see isSubstring under Helpful_Problems.

### Chapter 2 - Linked Lists

- [x] 2.1 - Remove Dups
- [x] 2.2 - Return Kth to Last
- [x] 2.3 - Delete Middle Node -> I overcomplicated this one on my first attempt. This is as simple as finding the node before the one to remove, and changing its pointer to the one after it.
- [x] 2.4 - Partition
- [x] 2.5 - Sum Lists
- [x] 2.6 - Palindrome
- [x] 2.7\* - Intersection -> The O(n) time and O(1) space solution to this problem was a little tricky, worth looking at again.
- [x] 2.8\* - Loop Detection -> This one requires you to know the "Tortoise and the Hare" algorithm for its best solution. I would recommend reviewing this algorithm in detail, especially how to return the index of the start of the cycle.

### Chapter 3 - Stacks and Queues

- [x] 3.1\* - Three in One -> This one is simple in theory, but difficult to fully implement, because there are alot of areas where you can get out of bounds exceptions.
- [x] 3.2\* - Stack Min -> Tricky at first, but simple when you realize that additional space complexity is required.
- [x] 3.3 - Stack of Plates
- [x] 3.4 - Queue via Stacks
- [x] 3.5\* - Sort Stack
- [x] 3.6 - Animal Shelter

### Chapter 4 - Trees and Graphs

- [ ] 4.1 - Route Between Nodes
- [ ] 4.2 - Minimal Tree
- [ ] 4.3 - List of Depths
- [ ] 4.4 - Check Balanced
- [ ] 4.5 - Validate BST
- [ ] 4.6 - Successor
- [ ] 4.7 - Build Order
- [ ] 4.8 - First Common Anscestor
- [ ] 4.9 - BST Sequences
- [ ] 4.10 - Check Subtree
- [ ] 4.11 - Random Node
- [ ] 4.12 - Paths With Sum
